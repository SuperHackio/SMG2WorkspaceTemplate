# This folder will be part of your development

Here should be all files related to actually making music as well as any .mp3 / .wav files that you have. You can organize this however you want to.<br/>**DO NOT PUT .AST FILES HERE**.
This is to avoid the situation where you forget to put a newer version of the AST into the game files.
