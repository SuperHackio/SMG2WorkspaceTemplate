# This folder will be part of your development

This folder is where **all files relating to 3D models** should be located.<br/>You can organize this however you choose, but **DO NOT PUT .ARC FILES IN HERE**.
This is to avoid the situation where you forget to put a newer version of the model into the game files.

This folder will likely contain files with the following extensions:
- .blend
- .png
- .json
- .bmd [^1]
- .bdl [^1]
- .btk [^1]
- .btp [^1]
- .bck [^1]

This folder should NOT contain files with the following extensions:
- .arc
- .rarc
- .szs

> *This Readme can be deleted if you want*

[^1]: It is not advised to keep these formats in here for very long after putting them into a .arc file to avoid confusion and forgetting which version is the latest version of the file
