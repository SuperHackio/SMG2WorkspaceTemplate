# This folder will be part of your development

Here is where all [Syati](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/Syati) based code should be located.<br/>Alternatively, you can put Syati here as a [Git Submodule](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255) if you like.

> *Why the name "Code_Syati"?<br/>
> It is named that way because hacks may have multiple different code bases, (For example, [Galaxy Level Engine](https://github.com/SuperHackio/GalaxyLevelEngine) if you compile it yourself) and these codebases should be kept separate from each other to avoid confusion.*
